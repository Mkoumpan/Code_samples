# 🧠 Recidivism Forecasting Challenge

## Overview
This project was developed for the [NIJ Recidivism Forecasting Challenge](https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge), which aimed to improve the prediction of recidivism outcomes using advanced data-driven approaches. The challenge focused on developing transparent, fair, and explainable models to support decision-making in criminal justice systems.

## 🧩 Situation
Recidivism—when individuals reoffend after being released from incarceration—is a complex issue with societal, economic, and ethical implications. The challenge provided anonymized datasets from various jurisdictions, containing demographic, criminal history, and supervision data.  
The goal was to create models that could accurately forecast recidivism risk while maintaining fairness and interpretability.

## 🎯 Task
Develop and evaluate predictive models for recidivism over 3-year and 6-year horizons.  
Key requirements included:
- Handling missing and imbalanced data.
- Ensuring fairness across demographic subgroups.
- Providing interpretable outputs that could guide policy and decision-making.
